# SimsFinder
If you are developing an iOS application and working with files, you need to test creating / copying / deleting files and folders on the simulator disk.

As you know, iOS uses metadataUUID as the names of application folders, therefore it is very difficult to find the necessary data of your application in the structure of the simulator folders.

SimsFinder solves this problem. 

Run SimsFinder, select iOS Simulator and find in Finder necessary files and folders fast and easy.
